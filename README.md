# Arduino-InputDebounce library
This arduino library is for debouncing an input pin.
Why I wrote my own lib instad of using one of the readily available ones like "bounce"?
Well, practice my friend ;) I'm just learning C++ and writing your own code makes you better, faster and more knowledgeable!

So if you find errors: Please report them so I can learn even more!
